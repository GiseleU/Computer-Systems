1. The cache consists of 256-byte cache lines, each capable of storing 64 four-byte integers. 
   Initially, with an empty cache, we incur at least one cache miss for the first access. However, after the initial miss, 
   all four integers from both vectors fit within a single cache line.
   This results in a cache miss rate of 25% (1 miss out of 4 total accesses), yielding a cache hit rate of 75%.

2. As the length of the vectors increases, the cache hit rate improves until it reaches a point of diminishing returns.  
    When the combined length of both vectors is 64 or less, we experience one cache miss, resulting in a cache miss rate that 
    decreases as vector length increases. With an increasing number of accesses corresponding to longer vectors, the cache 
    miss rate decreases due to the progressively longer lengths. This trend leads to an inversely related improvement in 
    the cache hit rate, as there are only two cache states: hit or miss.

3. The cache hit rate improves as vector lengths increase, up to a point where each vector has a length of 32, resulting in a 
    hit rate of 98.4314%. However, for very large vectors exceeding this limit, the cache hit rate drops 
    significantly due to cache capacity constraints. When a single vector's length reaches 16,384, 
    the cache rate becomes 0.0031 since it cannot accommodate both vectors, causing a substantial drop in performance as data retrieval 
    extends down to main memory.

4. To optimize the cache configuration for large vectors with lengths exceeding 8192, one approach is to divide them into 
    8192-chunk segments that can comfortably fit within the cache block. This segmentation enables the cache to maintain a 
    high hit rate of 98.4314% for each 8192-chunk, improving overall performance.
